# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type by using Pythons skills and Pandas. Also, by using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data along with the multiple-line graph for the total weekly fares are used together to illustrate how the data differs per each city type and how those differences can be used by the decision makers at PyBer.
